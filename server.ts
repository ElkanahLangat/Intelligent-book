1. **Wealth is What You Don't See**
   - *Spending money to show people how much money you have is the fastest way to have less money.*
   - True wealth is options, flexibility, and autonomy. It is the unexercised freedom to wake up and decide what to do with your time today.
   
2. **The Compounding Asymmetry**
   - Compounding works like an exponential curve: 95% of Warren Buffett's wealth was accumulated after age 65.
   - The greatest financial skill is not getting huge returns—it is staying power and endurance without getting wiped out in downturns.

3. **Managing the Psychology of Money in Startups**
   - **Separate Net Worth from Self-Worth:** A fluctuating valuation on a cap table is not a verdict on your human intelligence.
   - **Control Your Burn Rate:** In both your company and your personal life, lifestyle creep destroys runway before product-market fit arrives.
   - **The Freedom Dividend:** Aim for freedom over prestige. Money's greatest intrinsic value is the ability to control your calendar.

#### Actionable Takeaways:
- Calculate your personal and company "Zero Cash Date" today.
- Automate savings into low-cost index assets regardless of startup volatility.
- Focus on building durable compounding assets rather than chasing status symbols.`;

    return `### ${greeting}Atomic Founder Habits & Executive System Management

1. **The Daily 3-Win Protocol**
   - Every morning before opening Slack or email, write down the **single needle-moving task** that will make everything else easier or unnecessary.
   - Protect your first 90 minutes of cognitive peak energy for deep creation (writing, coding, or customer problem synthesis).

2. **Managing Your Things: Radical Asynchronous Systems**
   - **The Eisenhower Quadrant for Founders:** Ruthlessly eliminate Urgent-Not-Important tasks. Delegate or automate anything that does not require your specific strategic leverage.
   - **Batching Context Switches:** Move all 1:1 meetings and external calls into dedicated two-afternoon blocks per week. Keep full days meeting-free for deep work.
   - **Weekly Sunday Retrospective:** Spend 30 minutes every Sunday reviewing the previous week's inputs (hours in deep work, customer calls completed) vs lagging outcomes.

3. **Founder Stamina & Anti-Burnout Hygiene**
   - Sleep is a performance multiplier: 7+ hours of quality sleep directly impacts risk calculation and emotional equanimity.
   - When anxiety strikes, focus on the immediate next physical action rather than catastrophic 6-month projections.

#### 7-Day Sprint Action Plan:
- Block out 8:00 AM – 10:00 AM daily as protected no-interruption deep work.
- Conduct a calendar audit: kill or decline at least 3 low-value meetings this week.
- Set a digital sundown 45 minutes before sleep to restore executive focus.`;

1. **You Are Almost Certainly Underpricing**
   - Early-stage founders consistently undercharge out of imposter syndrome and fear of rejection.
   - Low prices attract high-maintenance, low-commitment customers who churn at the first bump. Higher prices filter for serious buyers who demand value and provide actionable feedback.

2. **Align with the Core Value Metric**
   - Charge based on what expands as the customer succeeds (e.g. Stripe charges per transaction, Slack charges per active seat, Snowflake charges per compute query).
   - If your price scales naturally with their usage or revenue, you never have to renegotiate contract terms as they grow.

3. **The 10x ROI Rule**
   - If your B2B product saves a company $50,000 in engineering time or compliance penalties, charging $5,000/year (10% of value generated) is an instant no-brainer for the buyer.

#### Practical Steps to Execute:
- Double your prices for the next 5 prospect sales conversations to discover your true willingness-to-pay ceiling.
- Introduce an annual upfront discount (e.g., 2 months free) to immediately boost cash runway.
- Avoid offering permanent free tiers unless your product possesses organic viral expansion loops.`;

  return `### ${greeting}Strategic Analysis & Actionable Founder Guidance

#### 1. Executive Summary & First Principles
When tackling this in an early-stage startup, the most critical mistake is over-complicating before finding fundamental traction. Startups survive by maximizing **learning velocity per dollar spent**.

#### 2. Core Framework & Tactics
- **De-risk the Single Biggest Assumption First:**
  Identify what must be true for this to work. Focus 80% of your energy on validating that specific hypothesis before writing code or spending marketing budget.
- **Engage Direct Customer Truth:**
  Speak with at least 5 ideal profile users weekly. Never ask "Would you buy this?" (they will politely lie). Ask: *"How did you solve this last week, what did it cost, and what was the most painful part of that process?"*
- **Focus on the Retention Beachhead:**
  Find 20–50 core users who genuinely cannot live without your product. It is far better to have 100 people who love you than 10,000 who vaguely like you.

#### 3. Immediate 3-Step Action Plan:
1. **Define the Success Metric:** Pick one leading indicator metric (e.g., weekly active users completing core actions) to track daily.
2. **Strip Non-Core Distractions:** Remove 50% of the peripheral roadmap features to launch an ultra-focused MVP.
3. **Establish a Rapid Iteration Loop:** Ship updates every 48–72 hours based strictly on recorded user friction.`;
